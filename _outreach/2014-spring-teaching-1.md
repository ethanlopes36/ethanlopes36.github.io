I am also a mentor for the Montoya Frosh and Transfer Scholars Program, which is an El Centro-sponsored program that pairs grad students with first year undergraduate students from undergraduate backgrounds. The program offers workshops on essential life skills such as time-management, mindfulness techniques, financial literary and public speaking. In my case in particular, I offer insights into the unique challenges and opportunities for Latinx students in STEM.
