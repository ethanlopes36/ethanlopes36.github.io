I am passionate about engaging with the public and inspiring future scientists through a variety of outreach activities. Below are some of the organizations and initiatives I’ve been involved with.

My efforts as a DEI liaison and student coordinator within the Doerr School of Sustainability have focused on building community across departments by organizing events that connect graduate students and address barriers to interdepartmental engagement. I’ve helped lead initiatives such as departmental mixers and DEI-focused gatherings, including the “DEI Coffee Convo” series, which celebrates underrepresented scientists and promotes local community support. I also contribute to recruitment and outreach through tabling events, GRAD Day, and work as a recruitment ambassador. In addition, I have overseen the advertisement and review process for the SDSS Dean's Sustainability Leaders postdoc program, further supporting efforts to foster inclusive excellence in research. As a former SURGE program assistant, I supported research and professional development activities for undergraduate scholars through mentorship, workshops, and community-building events. Across these roles, I work to strengthen support networks, elevate marginalized voices, and make academic spaces more accessible and welcoming.

Pertenecer is a Stanford-based program that connects K–12 students from underrepresented backgrounds with mentors and hands-on experiences in environmental sciences. The program aims to introduce students to careers in Earth sciences and academia, increase their comfort and confidence in college settings, and broaden their understanding of what it means to be an Earth scientist. Above all, Pertenecer strives to show students that they belong in spaces like Stanford and within the broader Earth science community.

I supported the Truckee Meadows Parks Foundation’s mission to enhance community livability through public engagement, education, and environmental sustainability. I designed and implemented NGSS-aligned curricula for K–12 students in the Washoe County School District, reaching 272 students—68% of whom reported increased interest in pursuing a science career. I’m especially proud of initiating a bilingual program that integrated Spanish into lesson plans and outreach materials, helping make science more accessible to Hispanic families.

I tutored a group of 25 Bhutanese and Nepalese refugees in preparation for their GED science exam, with a focus on physical sciences content.
