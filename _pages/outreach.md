I am passionate about engaging with the public and inspiring future scientists of all backgrounds through a variety of outreach activities. Check out some of the cool organizations and initiatives I’ve been involved with!

My efforts as a DEI liaison and student coordinator within the Doerr School of Sustainability have focused on building community across departments by organizing events that connect graduate students and address barriers to interdepartmental engagement. I’ve helped lead initiatives such as departmental mixers and DEI-focused gatherings, including the “DEI Coffee Convo” series, which celebrates underrepresented scientists and promotes local community support. I also contribute to recruitment and outreach through tabling events, GRAD Day, and work as a recruitment ambassador. In addition, I have overseen the advertisement and review process for the SDSS Dean's Sustainability Leaders postdoc program, further supporting efforts to foster inclusive excellence in research. As a former SURGE program assistant, I supported research and professional development activities for undergraduate scholars through mentorship, workshops, and community-building events. Across these roles, I work to strengthen support networks, elevate marginalized voices, and make academic spaces more accessible and welcoming.

Pertenecer is a Stanford-based program that connects K–12 students from underrepresented backgrounds with mentors and hands-on experiences in environmental sciences. The program aims to introduce students to careers in Earth sciences and academia, increase their comfort and confidence in college settings, and broaden their understanding of what it means to be an Earth scientist. Above all, Pertenecer strives to show students that they belong in spaces like Stanford and within the broader Earth science community.

## [Various Mentorship Positions](https://sesur.stanford.edu/)

I have taken on several mentorship roles in both scientific and interpersonal settings. As a research mentor for the Sustainability, Engineering, and Science Undergraduate Research (SESUR) program, I guided a first-year student through a one-unit spring course and a 10-week summer project. I trained her in microscopy, rock magnetism, and paleomagnetic techniques, helping her connect daily lab work to broader scientific questions and ultimately supporting her in presenting her findings at a research symposium. This summer, I’m excited to continue mentoring through the Sustainability Undergraduate Research in Geoscience and Engineering (SURGE) program.

In more interpersonal settings, I serve as a mentor for the Vice Provost for Graduate Education’s Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE) program, where I organize informal lunches and provide guidance on navigating graduate school. I also supported my EDGE mentee in her successful NSF GRFP application. Additionally, I mentor through the Montoya Frosh and Transfer Scholars Program, an El Centro-sponsored initiative that pairs graduate students with first-year undergraduates from historically underrepresented backgrounds. This program includes workshops on time management, mindfulness, financial literacy, and public speaking. In my mentorship, I offer particular insight into the unique challenges and opportunities faced by Latinx students in STEM.

I supported the Truckee Meadows Parks Foundation’s mission to enhance community livability through public engagement, education, and environmental sustainability. I designed and implemented NGSS-aligned curricula for K–12 students in the Washoe County School District, reaching 272 students—68% of whom reported increased interest in pursuing a science career. I’m especially proud of initiating a bilingual program that integrated Spanish into lesson plans and outreach materials, helping make science more accessible to Hispanic families.
