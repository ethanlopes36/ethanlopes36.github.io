My doctoral research investigates how the serpentinization process, a fluid-rock interaction, can alter the magnetic properties of ultramafic, or mantle-derived, rocks in the formation of secondary magnetic minerals. I take a two-pronged approach in my investigation: conducting laboratory experiments that simulate hydrothermal conditions and analyzing naturally altered rocks from the Atlantic Ocean. Expanding on the latter, I had the unique opportunity to serve as an American representative for International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 399, where we drilled and analyzed cores from the Atlantis Massif, an underwater mountain along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Since ultramafic rocks are typically deep-seated, drilling at sites like the Atlantis Massif—where faulting exhumes these normally inaccessible rocks—provides critical access for studying the complex serpentinization process.

controlled laboratory experiments wherein we serpentinize fresh dunite and assess changes in rock magnetic and physical properties post-alteration.
