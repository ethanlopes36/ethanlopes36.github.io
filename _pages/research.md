My doctoral research investigates how the serpentinization process, a fluid-rock interaction, can alter the magnetic properties of ultramafic, or mantle-derived, rocks in the formation of secondary magnetic minerals. I take a two-pronged approach in my investigation: conducting laboratory experiments that simulate hydrothermal conditions and analyzing naturally altered rocks from the Atlantic Ocean. Expanding on the latter, I had the unique opportunity to serve as an American representative for International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 399, where we drilled and analyzed cores from the Atlantis Massif, an underwater mountain along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Since ultramafic rocks are typically deep-seated, drilling at sites like the Atlantis Massif—where faulting exhumes these normally inaccessible rocks—provides critical access for studying the complex serpentinization process.

## Changes in Rock Magnetic Properties with Serpentinization

Using rocks collected from IODP Expedition 399, I am studying how the rock magnetic properties change with increasing degree of serpentinization. Serpentinite magnetization intensity and domain state results provide key insights into serpentinization’s role in crustal magnetization, with potential implications for understanding how fluid-rock processes could play a role in the formation of long-lived magnetically intense anomalies on Earth and other planetary bodies, including Mars.

## Reading the Magnetism Recorded within Serpentinites

By conducting demagnetization experiments of serpentinites and mafic rocks recovered at the footwall, can compare and contrast these magnetic directions to those from other regions of the Atlantis Massif, notably the dome. I am helping to reconstruct the entire massif’s deformation history. Thus, these experiments are a key component in the expedition’s broader effort to understand the exhumation process of ultramafic rocks and the formation of oceanic core complexes.

## Other Projects

Inspired by different serpentine polymorphs, experimentally investigated how fibrous microstructural arrangements controls failure mode. Used synthetic sand-epoxy composites with endmember fiber geometries—aligned and entangled and characterized deformation using paired triaxial shear tests and acoustic emission monitoring. The significance of this study lies in its support for the framework that microscopic characteristics influence macroscopic properties.enhance our understanding of how different lithologies influence the nucleation and propagation of seismic events, including slow seismic events and large earthquakes.

Across the globe, wildfires are increasing in both frequency and severity, exposing millions to toxic aerosols enriched in iron oxides and other metal phases that are produced via various redox reactions during burning. Nano-scale iron oxides pose a particular health risk, as they can easily enter and persist in the human body. Using serpentine soils collected in CA (fun fact, serpentine is the state rock of CA!), work with a team of soil scientists to see how rock magnetic properties change with increasing burn temperatures. Overall, these magnetic properties may serve as proxies for reconstructing the thermal conditions of past fires and provide insight into the scaling of human health risks with fire severity.
